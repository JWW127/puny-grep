## What is this?
Puny-grep is just another light version of grep. Being a light version, that means it doesn't carry all the functionality of a fully fleshed out version of grep.

## Why? Don't we have enough GREPs?
Yes there are a lot of grep applications, the reason for this one is to further my understanding of Rust.
As a matter of fact this will be my 2nd simplistic version, as both [Rust In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) & The Official [Rust-lang.org](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) both implement examples of grep for learning.

## Looking for a premium grep application?
Try [Ripgrep](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) by BurntSushi, I highly recommend it.

## Pung-Grep Usage
`puny-grep <needle> <haystack_file.txt> <case_sensitive_bool>`<br/>
example <br/>
`puny-grep friends spice-girls.txt false`
Yes I provided spice girls lyrics for you :) .
